1. Create the 'authentication index' by sending this gremlin script in the console
before indexing:

g.createAutomaticIndex('authentication', Vertex.class, ['fb_id', 'email'] as Set)

----
2. When we run g.clear() there are two ('vertices' and 'edges') auto indices
created, and these have all properties being indexed.


3. Either method seems to work. I did a db restart and and all the indices are
still there. But when I ran a g.clear() the authentication index is gone.

4. I rerun the authentication index and everything is working again.
